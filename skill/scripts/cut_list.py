"""cut-list.md from the RENDERED spans: every stretch of source that is not in the rough cut
(head, every gap between consecutive rendered segments, tail), with its reason taken from the
removed tokens inside it. Covers 100% of the removed time by construction.

Usage (from the edit dir): python3 cut_list.py <title> <source_transcript.json> [notes.md]
  <source_transcript.json>: the Scribe transcript of the SOURCE the rough cut was planned on
  (rough-cut/transcripts/<name>.json). notes.md (optional) is appended under "Notes" (kept on
  purpose, judgement calls); hand edits recorded in edl.json flags are listed automatically.
Reads rough-cut/edl.json, rough-cut/render_report.json, segments.json. Writes cut-list.md.
